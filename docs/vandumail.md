Dear Ma'am,

We have deliberated internally on the requirements you have specified for monitoring and reporting service activities. We have given every point it's due consideration and have drafted a process which can be followed diligently over time.


1. Reporting Format - 
    a) We will setup a google sheet and share with you. 
    b) Our field coordinator will continuously update the sheet, so that you can have access to the data at any time you want. 
    c) We will not send emails on this topic as that will cause loss of consistency.

2. What will be in the Report (Google Sheet)
    a) There will be two sheets - Complaints and Routine Checkup
    b) Complaint Sheet - This sheet will contain following items for every complaint raised by your team. 
        1. date of complaint
        2. Complaint description
        3. date of visit
        4. issues identified
        5. services done

        3. Issues identified (if any)
        4. Repair done - yes /no
        5. Reason for Not Repairing


3. Process to be followed for Routine Check-up
   1. Technician will report to the yard for routine check-up
   2. Once technician reaches, we will inform the same on WhatsApp group
